Poodll New Module for Moodle
=============
This is a special cpassignment for creating Poodll based apps

1) Download/Clone as folder cpassignment in your Moodle mod directory
2) Run a rename script, or tool, to turn all references to 'cpassignment' to your module name e.g 'mymodule'. hint: make it all lowercase and oneword
3) Make sure any files in the renamed cpassignment directory are also renamed. Notably files under /classes/task /backup and /lang/en need to be renamed
4) Strings in the lang/en/cpassignment.txt were called "CloudPoodll Assignment" so replace "CloudPoodll Assignment" with your nice human version of the module name, eg "My Module"
5) After you install you will need a Poodll API key. Email for that. I will get you one


After it is all installed you will have a rough audio/video assignment with audio/video/text feedback capability. Its just all there, but not looking pretty. You will have some work to do
